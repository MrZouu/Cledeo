***Project date : 2021***

##  Description
Cluedo is a board game where the goal is to solve, by deduction, the enigma of this crime. To win you have to find the murderer, the weapon used and the place of the murder

* For our Cludeo version, we chose the Batman universe, in the arkham asylum, where the characters and weapons are references to the license

⚠️This project is the result of a common work, made for school with a deadline and I chose to leave it as it was at the time of submission

# Features

## Main Menu

# User guide
**Interactions are on the terminal**

* Selections are made using the arrow keys

* To move your character, use the arrow keys

* The die gives you a number of moves

* When you enter a room, you can make an assumption

# Display
I use an ANSI table to display the game rooms on the terminal. 
Each symbol is associated with specific format codes, making the visual display more attractive and easier for players to understand.
