##  Description
Cluedo is a board game where the goal is to solve, by deduction, the enigma of this crime. To win you have to find the murderer, the weapon used and the place of the murder

* For our Cludeo version, we chose the Batman universe, in the arkham asylum, where the characters and weapons are references to the license
